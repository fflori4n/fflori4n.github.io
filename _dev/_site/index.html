            nod3-comfirm - Common firmware for ESP32 based devices
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Aug 3, 2025</span><p><strong>nod3-comfirm</strong> - is an ESP_IDF based firmware intended to be used as a template/ starting point for future IoT projects. It is primarily written for ESP C3.
Using ESP_IDF and modern(ish) C++ ( <em>to avoid the usual cowboy enthics of C projects ~ though it is less efficient</em> ), nod3-comfirm aims to be used as a basic firmware for smart sensor devices. Firmware has basic functions that are needed for every IoT thing, like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Network management (WLAN)</li>
  <li>IO Control</li>
  <li>ADC continous/ DMA and other ADC functions</li>
  <li>Time keeping, NTP and RTC functions</li>
  <li>Websocket communication with Homeassistant custom component</li>
  <li>libraries for common sensors using I2C</li>
</ul>

        <span class="post-meta">Feb 10, 2023</span><p>R&amp;D project in collaboration with Drontech (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dronteh">Drontech Facebook page</a>) to develop a proof of concept for a device that uses computer vision to estimate plant mass beneath a drone.
A GPIO pin is set to HIGH when plant mass exceeds a defined threshold, the signal is intended to control sprayer valves, turning off pesticide flow when the area under the flight path lacks viable cultivation or the plants have dried out, avoiding unnecessary pesticide use on unproductive areas.</p>
